# MIDI Studio UI (ms-ui)

Shared LVGL UI primitives/components for MIDI Studio targets:

- standalone firmware/app (`midi-studio/core`)
- DAW plugins firmware UIs (ex: `midi-studio/plugin-bitwig`)

This repo is product-level (not OpenControl). It intentionally keeps DAW-specific logic and themes out.
